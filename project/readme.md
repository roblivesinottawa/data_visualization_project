A correlation between Corruption and Development Corruption Perceptions Index ,
 2011 (Rating from 1 To 10 where 10 is the least corrupt nation)
 Human Developement Index, 2011 (Rating from 0.1 To 1.0 where 1 is best)

Comparing the corruption index with the UN's Human Development Index
 (a measure combining health, wealth and education), demonstrates an interesting connection.
 When the corruption index is between approximately 2.0 and 4.0 there appears to be 
little relationship with the human development index,
 but as it rises beyond 4.0 a stronger connection can be seen. 
 Outliers include small but well-run poorer countries such as Bhutan and Cape Verde,
 while Greece and Italy stand out among the richer countries.
